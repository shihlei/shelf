### Binary Search

- sorted/ascending sequence
- searching for an element in a sorted array is **log(n)**. This just means that the number of times you can divide a number, n, by 2 until you get to 1 is logn
- This is why binary search is **log(n)**) because you can eliminate half of the elements in the array each time you make a comparison
- Include balance and unbalanced tree : balance can have **log(n)** time, unbalanced is not efficient
